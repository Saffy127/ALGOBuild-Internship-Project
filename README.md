### GitHub README for Product Inventory Dashboard with React and Firebase

# Product Inventory Dashboard

A simple, yet powerful web application to manage product inventory. Built with React for the front-end and Firebase for real-time database functionality. This project demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a product list, offering a practical example of integrating React with Firebase.

## Features

- **Real-time Database**: Utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing and retrieving product data in real time.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports adding, editing, deleting, and viewing products.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean UI that's adaptable to various screen sizes.
- **Easy Deployment**: Ready-to-deploy on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Firebase account

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-inventory-dashboard.git
cd product-inventory-dashboard
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Setup Firebase

1. Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add a new web app to your Firebase project.
3. Navigate to the project settings, find your Firebase configuration, and replace the placeholders in the `.env` file with your project's specific settings.

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
```

4. Enable Firestore Database in your Firebase project and set up the rules for public access or authenticated access as per your requirement.

### Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- **Add Product**: Use the form to add a new product. Fill in the product name and description and click "Add Product".
- **View Products**: View the list of products added to the inventory on the main dashboard.
- **Edit/Delete Product**: Each product has "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for easy management.
